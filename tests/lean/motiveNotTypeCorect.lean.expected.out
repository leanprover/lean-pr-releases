motiveNotTypeCorect.lean:7:6-7:7: error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, motive is not type correct

Explanation: The rewrite tactic rewrites an expression 'e' using an equality 'a = b' in the following way. First, it looks for all 'a' in 'e'. Second, it tries to abstract these occurrences of 'a' to create a function 'm' with the property that 'e = m a'. Third, we observe that 'congrArg' implies that `m a = m b`. Thus, if the goal was 'e', it suffices to prove 'm b' using 'Eq.mpr'. This function 'm' is called the *motive*. If 'e' depends on specific properties of 'a', then the motive might not typecheck.

Type-incorrect motive:
  fun _a => P _a d
Error: application type mismatch
  P _a d
argument
  d
has type
  D (f t) : Type
but is expected to have type
  D _a : Type
t : Nat
f : Nat → Nat
h : f t = t
d : D (f t)
P : (t : Nat) → D t → Prop
⊢ P (f t) d
